#NuLink

*Solution for Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Applications*

----------

NuLink is a decentralized solution for privacy-preserving application where we combine best practices with best of breed solutions. Nulink has  blockchain, access control (Proxy Re-Encryption, Attribute-Based Encryption) and secure computation (Zero-Knowledge Proof, Secure Multi-party Computation, Fully Homomorphic Encryption) as technical core, and it provides enterprise-level privacy data sharing and computation services.

##Overview
*Overview of Nulink Network*

----------


By integrating best in class technologies we are building a strong technology foundation. 

The Nulink network integrates the Application Layer, the Cryptograph Layer, the Storage Layer, the Blockchain Layer and the Watcher Network.

Nulink users can simply integrate into one single API and get access to multiple storage and BlockChain solutions. For key management we integrate into Nucyper. 

Miners can get our token NLK in storage layer by providing decentralized storage services and also in watcher layer by relaying information from ETH.
